## How to use it
There are two ways to host SearXNG. The first one doesn't require any prior knowledge about self-hosting and thus is recommended for beginners. It includes caddy as a reverse proxy and automatically deals with the TLS certificates for you. The second one is recommended for more advanced users that already have their own reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx, HAProxy, ...) and probably some other services running on their machine. The first few steps are the same for both installation methods however.

1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
2. Get searxng-docker
  ```sh
  cd /usr/local
  git clone https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker.git
  cd searxng-docker
  ```
3. Edit the [.env](https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker/blob/master/.env) file to set the hostname and an email
4. Generate the secret key `sed -i "s|ultrasecretkey|$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g" searxng/settings.yml`  
   On a Mac: `sed -i '' "s|ultrasecretkey|$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g" searxng/settings.yml`
5. Edit [searxng/settings.yml](https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker/blob/master/searxng/settings.yml) according to your needs

> [!NOTE]
> Windows users can use the following powershell script to generate the secret key:
> ```powershell
> $randomBytes = New-Object byte[] 32
> (New-Object Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider).GetBytes($randomBytes)
> $secretKey = -join ($randomBytes | ForEach-Object { "{0:x2}" -f $_ })
> (Get-Content searxng/settings.yml) -replace 'ultrasecretkey', $secretKey | Set-Content searxng/settings.yml
> ```

### Method 1: With Caddy included (recommended for beginners)
6. Run SearXNG in the background: `docker compose up -d`

### Method 2: Bring your own reverse proxy (experienced users)
6. Remove the caddy related parts in `docker-compose.yaml` such as the caddy service and its volumes.
7. Point your reverse proxy to the port set for the `searxng` service in `docker-compose.yml` (8080 by default).
8. Generate and configure the required TLS certificates with the reverse proxy of your choice.
9. Run SearXNG in the background: `docker compose up -d`

> [!NOTE]
> You can change the port `searxng` listens on inside the docker container (e.g. if you want to operate in `host` network mode) with the `BIND_ADDRESS` environment variable (defaults to `[::]:8080`). The environment variable can be set directly inside `docker-compose.yaml`.

## Troubleshooting - How to access the logs

To access the logs from all the containers use: `docker compose logs -f`.

To access the logs of one specific container:

- Caddy: `docker compose logs -f caddy`
- SearXNG: `docker compose logs -f searxng`
- Valkey: `docker compose logs -f redis`

### Start SearXNG with systemd

You can skip this step if you don't use systemd.
1. Copy the service template file:
   ```sh
   cp searxng-docker.service.template searxng-docker.service
   ```
  
2. Edit the content of ```WorkingDirectory``` in the ```searxng-docker.service``` file (only if the installation path is different from ```/usr/local/searxng-docker```)
   
3. Enable the service:
   ```sh
   systemctl enable $(pwd)/searxng-docker.service
   ```

4. Start the service:
   ```sh
   systemctl start searxng-docker.service
   ```

**Note:** Ensure the service file path matches your installation directory before enabling it.

## Multi Architecture Docker images

Supported architecture:

- amd64
- arm64
- arm/v7

## How to update ?

To update the SearXNG stack:

```sh
git pull
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Or the old way (with the old docker-compose version):

```sh
git pull
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```
