## How to use it

- [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- Get searxng-docker
  ```sh
  cd /usr/local
  git clone https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker.git
  cd searxng-docker
  ```
- Edit the [.env](https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker/blob/master/.env) file to set the hostname and an email
- Generate the secret key `sed -i "s|ultrasecretkey|$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g" searxng/settings.yml`
- Edit the [searxng/settings.yml](https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker/blob/master/searxng/settings.yml) file according to your need
- Check everything is working: `docker compose up`
- Run SearXNG in the background: `docker compose up -d`

> [!WARNING]  
> If you use an older version of docker desktop (`< 3.6.0`), you may have to install Docker Compose v1.
> Accordingly, you should modify the commands in this documentation to suit Docker Compose v1. For instance, change 'docker compose up' to 'docker-compose up'.
>
> [Install the docker-compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#scenario-two-install-the-compose-plugin) (be sure that docker-compose version is at least 1.9.0)

> [!NOTE]  
> Windows users can use the following powershell script to generate the secret key:
> ```powershell
> $randomBytes = New-Object byte[] 32
> (New-Object Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider).GetBytes($randomBytes)
> $secretKey = -join ($randomBytes | ForEach-Object { "{0:x2}" -f $_ })
> (Get-Content searxng/settings.yml) -replace 'ultrasecretkey', $secretKey | Set-Content searxng/settings.yml
> ```

## How to access the logs

To access the logs from all the containers use: `docker compose logs -f`.

To access the logs of one specific container:

- Caddy: `docker compose logs -f caddy`
- SearXNG: `docker compose logs -f searxng`
- Valkey: `docker compose logs -f redis`

### Start SearXNG with systemd

You can skip this step if you don't use systemd.

- ```cp searxng-docker.service.template searxng-docker.service```
- edit the content of ```WorkingDirectory``` in the ```searxng-docker.service``` file (only if the installation path is different from /usr/local/searxng-docker)
- Install the systemd unit:
  ```sh
  systemctl enable $(pwd)/searxng-docker.service
  systemctl start searxng-docker.service
  ```

## Note on the image proxy feature

The SearXNG image proxy is activated by default.

The default [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) allow the browser to access to ```${SEARXNG_HOSTNAME}``` and ```https://*.tile.openstreetmap.org;```.

If some users want to disable the image proxy, you have to modify [./Caddyfile](https://github.com/searxng/searxng-docker/blob/master/Caddyfile). Replace the ```img-src 'self' data: https://*.tile.openstreetmap.org;``` by ```img-src * data:;```.

## Multi Architecture Docker images

Supported architecture:

- amd64
- arm64
- arm/v7

## How to update ?

To update the SearXNG stack:

```sh
git pull
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Or the old way (with the old docker-compose version):

```sh
git pull
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```
